# FinallyTheseRecipes
Adds recipes for many popular mods to skip crafting steps while maintaining the
ingredient cost.


The inspiration for this mod was the shortcut "Hardened" recipes from Thermal
Expansion, to spend four tin and four invar to jump straight to Hardened tier.
FinallyTheseRecipes takes this to the logical extreme, adding recipes to go from
basic directly to Reinforced, and Hardened directly to Resonant. Pretty much
anywhere there's a tiered recipe like that with room to skip a step, this mod
intends to add recipes to skip the step.


Additionally, there are a lot of nugget recipes out there. Where possible, we'll
add "bulk crafting" recipes to turn ingots into nine times as much product.


Finally, this mod will consider the mod environment it finds itself in, and add
storage blocks wherever you need them. Love compressed cobblestone but don't want
ExtraUtilities dimensions? We've got you covered. Love EU but want ender pearl
blocks too? FinallyTheseRecipes won't step on the compressed cobblestone that's
already present.


The mod landscape is a very, *very* complicated place, and I definitely won't see
all the opportunities for making our lives easier, so drop in a feature request
if you see a way to collapse recipes that isn't in here.
